Using Python, I was tasked to find the distance between a group of people's home address cities and work address cities for people telecommuting for their jobs. I found the distance in radians, then created a matrix that found the distance between every possible location. I did later go in and add a lookup to match the distances with the correct person, but I didn't include that in this code.
